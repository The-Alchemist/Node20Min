# Node.js in 20 Minutes

A short code-focused presentation of Node.js that takes about 20 minutes to present.

This presentation is for people who know how to program, but are new to Node.js.
It's assumed that JavaScript is known, but if you know some other high-level
language, you should be able to follow along. At the conclusion, you should have
a feel for some of the capabilities of Node.js.

The presentation has the following sections:

* [Hello World](https://github.com/stdarg/Node20Min/tree/master/01_HelloWorld) -
  the canonical "Hello World!" from the [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) website.
* [Convention - Error First](https://github.com/stdarg/Node20Min/tree/master/02_Convention_Error) -
  an explanation of the callback conventions around returning errors
* [Convention - Callback Last](https://github.com/stdarg/Node20Min/tree/master/03_Convention_Callback) -
  an explanation of the covention around placing the callback last.
* [Nested Callback](https://github.com/stdarg/Node20Min/tree/master/04_Nested_Callbacks) -
  dicussion around the issue of nested callbacks and flow control.
* [Streams](https://github.com/stdarg/Node20Min/tree/master/05_Streams) -
  brief explanation of streams with an example of reading from a stream.
* [Cluster](https://github.com/stdarg/Node20Min/tree/master/06_Cluster) -
  an explanation of cluster with an illustrative example.
* [Sockets](https://github.com/stdarg/Node20Min/tree/master/07_Sockets) -
  examples of TCP and UDP sockets in use.
* [Async Errors](https://github.com/stdarg/Node20Min/tree/master/08_Async_Errors) -
  An explanation of Node.js domains.
